This is an Arduino project to receive DMX values via XLR cable and translate them into color codes send via infrared led.

Thank's to Toni Merino for his [DMX library](http://www.deskontrol.net/blog/arduino-four-universes-dmx-512-library/)
and Ken Shirrif for the [IRremote library](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) !
